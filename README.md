# Condition-Monitoring-of-a-Hydraulic-System-using-data-driven-machine-learning-methods-using-Python
This is an MSc academic project for the course Systems Engineering, where we used   datadriven Machine Learning methods (Neural Network and Support Vector Machine) for condition monitoring of a Hydraulic System
## Task  
Data-driven machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines, Deep Neural Networks are to be applied for Condition Monitoring of a Hydraulic System (please refer the literature attached). Comparison of the testing results for the different machine learning methods. Detailed explanation is given [here](https://github.com/MdSaifulIslamSajol/Condition-Monitoring-of-a-Hydraulic-System-using-data-driven-machine-learning-methods-using-Python/blob/81c615255076a38e3f4c4035c55d639bbb5aa366/Assignment_Task_Description_hydraulic%20systemt.pdf)
